## Speaker Bios

### Dr. Sarah Chen
Associate Professor at Stanford University, specializing in experimental methods in social psychology. Her work focuses on how digital platforms shape social behavior and decision-making processes. Dr. Chen has published extensively in journals such as the American Journal of Sociology and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

### Prof. Michael Johnson
Principal Researcher at MIT Media Lab and Associate Professor of Political Science. His research examines how digital networks shape political polarization, information diffusion, and collective action. Prof. Johnson's recent book, "Networks of Influence," won the 2023 APSA Best Book Award.

### Dr. Aisha Williams
Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley's School of Information. Her research combines computational methods and cultural theory to analyze large-scale text data from social media, news, and literature. Dr. Williams has pioneered new methods for detecting cultural frames and narratives in digital texts.

### Dr. James Rodriguez
Associate Professor of Urban Studies at NYU. His work integrates geographical information systems with computational methods to study spatial patterns of inequality in urban environments. Dr. Rodriguez's recent projects examine how algorithmic decision-making impacts spatial segregation in cities.

### Ethics Panel
The panel will feature experts in computational ethics from various disciplines discussing challenges related to privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, and research integrity in computational social science.
