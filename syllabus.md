# SOC 10: Introduction to Computational Social Science
## Course Syllabus - Spring 2024-2025

### Course Overview
The large-scale digitization of social life is providing new opportunities and research directions for social scientists. In this course, we will discuss how social scientists, and sociologists in particular, are using advances in computational techniques to further our knowledge of society. Some of the topics we will survey include online experiments, massive online social networks, large-scale text analysis, and geographical information systems.

Specific dataset options and detailed requirements will be distributed in Week 3.

#### Final Project
The final project is an opportunity to design and execute an original research project using computational social science methods. Students will:
1. Identify a research question
2. Select appropriate computational methods
3. Collect and analyze data
4. Interpret findings and discuss implications
5. Present results to the class
6. Submit a final paper (10-15 pages) and well-documented code
